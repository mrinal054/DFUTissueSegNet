# DFUTissueSegNet
The goal of this project is to segment fibrin, granulation, and callus tissues in diabetic foot ulcer regions. 

**We have made the dataset public for wound tissue segmentation.**

**Codes and data are available 
[here](https://github.com/uwm-bigdata/DFUTissueSegNet).** <br><br>
We created the DFUTissue dataset with the Advancing the Zenith of Healthcare (AZH) Wound Center in Milwaukee, WI, to segment granulation, fibrin, and callus tissues in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The dataset includes 110 annotated foot ulcer images: 78 for training, 16 for validation, and 16 for testing, maintaining a 70:15:15 split. The images, sourced from the AZH Wound Center, were initially annotated by the Big Data Analytics and Visualization Lab at UWM and refined by AZH wound specialists.
